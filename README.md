PromptMaster AI Studio
PromptMaster is a high-performance, standalone web application designed for AI artists and prompt engineers. Unlike basic generators, it uses Google Search Grounding to perform a "Global Scan" of the entire internet—unearthing top-performing prompt structures from Facebook groups, Reddit communities (r/midjourney), and professional art forums.
✨ Key Features
🌐 Global Web Scan: Leverages Gemini 3 Pro to analyze viral prompt trends across social media and art communities in real-time.
⚡ One-Click Creation: Generate high-fidelity images directly within the app using the gemini-2.5-flash-image model.
📋 Pro Clipboard: Instantly copy complex, multi-layered prompts (including lighting, camera settings, and artist styles) to use in Midjourney or Stable Diffusion.
📱 PWA Ready: Install as a standalone desktop or mobile app for a native-feeling, fullscreen experience.
⏳ Quality First: Optimized search logic that prioritizes artistic depth over speed, ensuring every result is studio-grade.
